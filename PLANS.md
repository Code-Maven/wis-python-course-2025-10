## Day 3

* The grammar of Python see the [SYLLABUS](SYLLABUS.md)

* Circle: `pi = 3.14` or `math.pi`
* Show the titles of the issues for day 1.
* Remove `__pycache__` https://github.com/arielhindi/Python-Course-Assignments/tree/main/day02 and add it to `.gitignore`

* Go over the CLI example from day02

* [DNA_complement](https://github.com/AdibM02/python-course-assignments/blob/main/day02/DNA_complement.py)

* How can we make sure our code keeps doing the right thing?

* Data sets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
* Read data from a file: CSV file, Excel file


* Show the subject-lines of the issue and how there are at least 4 different types. How could we write code that recognizes them?


### Assignment (day 3)

* Pick 2 students that you don't know. Look at their web site. Open an issue on the repository of their web site and write what you liked about their site and what did you miss, how they might improve it.
When picking a student select one who does NOT yet have 2 issues. This way everyone will get 2 issues.
* Once you received such an issue, react to it and when you feel you have fulfilled the request (or decided you don't want to do that) close it.

* In the `day03` folder create a module with


* Open an issue on our repository with a title `day03 Your Name` linking to where your assignment is and linking to the two issues you opened.
