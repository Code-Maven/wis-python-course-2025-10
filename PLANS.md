## Day 4

* "I could not run your program", "there was an error" etc. These are not very useful reports.
It is much better to describe what you did and what do you see (e.g. what error messages).
Some people included screenshots of the problems they saw in the GUI. That's excellent.
On the other hand, for textual error messages from the terminal include the text in the report, not the screenshot of it.
Include the Operating System and its version (e.g. Windows 10), the language of your OS if that might be relevant (e.g. English, Hebrew, Arabic, Spanish, Italian etc.)
Especially the RTL languages can create trouble.
Include the version of Python you use.


Some people reported that tkinter does not work well with RTL languages such as Hebrew and Aarbic.
You might want to experiment with other GUI toolkits that look nicer and also support RTL text.
Ask the AI to suggest you a GUI framework.


* The grammar of Python see the [SYLLABUS](SYLLABUS.md)

* Circle: `pi = 3.14` or `math.pi`
* Show the titles of the issues for day 1.
* Remove `__pycache__` https://github.com/arielhindi/Python-Course-Assignments/tree/main/day02 and add it to `.gitignore`

* Manually write a module, use it and test it. (trianlge from day2 ?), check the code from day3

* Go over the CLI example from day02

* [DNA_complement](https://github.com/AdibM02/python-course-assignments/blob/main/day02/DNA_complement.py)
    * Use a dictionary to do this, use the `replace` method, or even better use a module to do this.


* [Python and Biology](https://python.code-maven.com/python-science/biology)


* How can we verify that our code does the right thing?
* How can we make sure our code keeps doing the right thing?

* Data sets from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/)
* Read data from a file: CSV file, Excel file


* Show the subject-lines of the issue and how there are at least 4 different types. How could we write code that recognizes them?
